\chapter{LITERATURE SURVEY}
\par Describe the various scholarly articles you've referred to reach the 
problem definition and that have helped you find a solution to the problem. Use 
proper citation standards. Use the bib file to store the reference database. Use 
\emph{cite} to refer to the work.

\par Organize the literature into sections carefully. There should be some 
correlation between the contents of each section. You can add a maximum of 15 
pages of literature survey\cite{kung1996regression}.

\par You can use figures and tables to strengthen your arguments. If any of 
these are taken from a reference paper, proper citation should be given in the 
caption. All figures must have the caption below the figure and all the tables 
must have the caption above the table. Use \emph{ref} to refer to each figure 
using the label provided for figures. See examples in further sections for 
details.
