\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
\par Give an introduction to your work here. Do not extend beyond 3 pages. Long introductions tend to bore the reader. Be short and precise.

\par Use the available space wisely. Use figures sparingly in the introduction. You can have sections and subsections in introduction. But too much of everything will affect the readability of the report.

\section{Organization of Report}
\par In the final section, describe the organization of the report. Use \emph{cite} to give citation to related work like this\cite{aho2003compilers}.

\par Example, Chapter 2 contains the literature survey, Chapter 3 contains the proposed method, and so on.
